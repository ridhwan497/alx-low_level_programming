This Repository is for the C concepts Arrays, Strings and Pointers.

Arrays

-> An array is defined as finite ordered collection of homogenous data, stored in contiguous memory locations.
                 
		type arrayName [ arraySize ];

Strings

-> Strings are actually one-dimensional array of characters terminated by a null character '\0'. Thus a null-terminated string contains the characters that comprise the string followed by a null. Example:
		
		char greeting[] = "Hello";

Pointers

-> A pointer is a variable whose value is the address of another variable, i.e., direct address of the memory location. Like any variable or constant, you must declare a pointer before using it to store any variable address. The general form of a pointer variable declaration is

	type *var-name;
